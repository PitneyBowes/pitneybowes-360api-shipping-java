    \ destination countries for a provided carrier and origin country.  | \n| Get\
    \ Services | This operation fetches a list of supported services for a carrier\

    \ Accounts| This operation retrieves onboarded Carriers with their Carrier Account\
    \ Ids which uniquely identify multiple accounts of same carrier.  | \n| Rate Shop\
    \ and Get Single Rate| This API contains 2 operations, rate shop and single rate.\
    \ Rate shop will fetch rates for all carrier services based on the given addresses\
    \ (From and To), weight, and dimension for given parcelType. Single rate will\
    \ get rate for specific service and special service (if requested) based on the\
    \ given addresses (From and To), weight, and dimension, parcelType and serviceId\
    \ with or without specialServices. Single rate will be used mainly to a rate a\
